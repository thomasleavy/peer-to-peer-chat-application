# Peer-to-Peer Chat Application
This is my implementation of a peer-to-peer chat application that I built using Node.js. It uses various dependencies, like readline, crypto, portastic, discovery-swarm, and dat-swarm-defaults.

# Includes
- decentralised peer-to-peer chat
- unique user IDs
- port ranges that are changeable
- messaging in real-time

# Please install node.js on system to operate
- npm install
- npm start
- npm install (dependency names, i.e. crypto - "npm install crypto", etc.)
